 SIMPLE SHELL

 NAME

         hsh - a simple command line interperter

 SYNOPSIS


 DESCRIPTION

 The shell is a simple command line interperter that executes the commands based on users input.


 HOW IT WORKS

 Prompt to the user ('$'), representing that it is ready to accept user input.  After it reads the arguments and executes the commands in order which are provided by the user.

 Order of execution of command -

 User input will split into tokens, these tokens will be compared to builtin command, if it matches then it will execute the  builtin command. Then user returns to pro    mpt. If the match is not found in builtin command, then tokens will be compared to executables in PATH or in PWD.  If the match is found in excutables, then execute t    he command and user return to the prompt.

 If the match is not found in both  builtin command and executables in PATH or PWD, then it prints Error Message and user return to the prompt.
